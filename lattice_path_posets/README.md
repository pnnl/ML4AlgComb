# Partial Orders on Lattice Paths (Open Problem)

NE lattice paths from $(0, 0)$ to $(a, b)$ are paths starting at $(0,0)$ and ending at $(a,b)$ which consist of a sequence of single unit steps either north and east  that never pass below the diagonal (see example below). These turn out to have deep connections to a number of topics in algebra, geometry, and number theory. In \[1\], Schiffler defines two order relations on such paths called *matching ordering* ($\leq_M$) and the *Lagrange ordering* ($\leq_L$) that are motivated constructions in the algebraic theory of cluster algebras and number theory. Matching ordering assigns a number to each lattice path based on the number of perfect matchings of an associated snake graph, while the Lagrange ordering assigns a number to each lattice path equal to the Lagrange number of a continued fraction. These numbers each define the respective partial order. In many ways, these orders are still poorly understood. For instance, one open question asks whether one can find a simple way of determining whether two paths $w$ and $w'$ have the same relationship in both orders ($w \leq_L w'$ and $w \leq_M w'$) or different relationships in both orders ($w \leq_L w'$ and $w \geq_M w'$ or vice versa) \[2\]. These datasets are designed to try to help solve this problem.

## Details and an example

Pairs of NE lattice paths $(w,w')$ on a grid of size $n \times n-1$ where $w'$ covers $w$ in either the matching or Lagrange order (but not both). We include $n = 10,11,12,13$.

## Dataset

Datasets can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wm9mtZQjXXQ4rl0TU9KtJ1T4RQaGsJNz/view?usp=sharing)

## Data Generation

Datasets were generated using SageMath. A SageMath notebook with the code to do this can be found in this repository.

## Task

**Math question:** As stated in [\[1\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02185), the problem is to "Study the posets $\mathcal{D}(a,b)$ and $\mathcal{D}$ with respect to $\leq_L$ and $\leq_M$." Where $\mathcal{D}(a,b)$ is the set of all NE lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(a,b)$ that never pass below the diagonal and $\mathcal{D} = \cup \mathcal{D}(a,b)$ where the union is taken over all integers $0 < a < b$ with $a,b$ relatively prime. 

**ML task:** Recall that $x$ covers $y$ in a partial order if $y < x$ and there is no $z$ such that $y < z < x$. Given a pair of lattice paths $(w,w')$, train a model that can predict whether $w'$ covers $w$ in either matching or Lagrange order (cases where $w'$ covers $w$ in both orders are few and have been excluded. 

Note that the ML task is far more specific that the math question. The idea is that a model that can effectively identify covers, has probably extracted useful features from lattice paths that carry interesting information about the partial orders $\leq_L$ and $\leq_M$.

## Small model performance

| Size | Logistic regression | MLP | Transformer | TODO | 
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| $n= 10$ | $66.2\\%$ | $90.6\\% \pm 0.8\\%$ | $65.3\\% \pm 0.0\\%$| $0.0\\%$ |
| $n= 11$ | $66.3\\%$ | $95.8\\% \pm 0.3\\%$ | $69.4\\% \pm 6.0\\%$| $0.0\\%$ |
| $n= 12$ | $66.5\\%$ | $98.6\\% \pm 0.1\\%$ | $86.2\\% \pm 14.2\\%$| $0.0\\%$ |

The $\pm$ signs indicate 95% confidence intervals from random weight initialization and training.
