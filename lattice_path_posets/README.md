# Partial Orders on Lattice Paths (Open Problem)

![Lattice path task](fig-lattice.png)

NE lattice paths from $(0, 0)$ to $(a, b)$ are paths starting at $(0,0)$ and ending at $(a,b)$ which consist of a sequence of single unit steps either north or east  that never pass below the diagonal (see example below). These turn out to have deep connections to a number of topics in algebra, geometry, and number theory. In \[1\], Schiffler defines two order relations on such paths called *matching ordering* ($\leq_M$) and *Lagrange ordering* ($\leq_L$) that are motivated by constructions in the algebraic theory of cluster algebras and number theory. Matching ordering assigns a number to each lattice path based on the number of perfect matchings of an associated snake graph, while the Lagrange ordering assigns a number to each lattice path equal to the Lagrange number of a continued fraction. These numbers each define their respective partial order. In many ways, these orders are still poorly understood. 

## Details and an example

We provide two different pairs of lattice paths below. The example on the left is a cover pair in Lagrange order. The example on the right is a covering pair in matching order.

## Dataset

Lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n+1) \times n$ are encoded by a sequence of $1$'s (for steps east) and $0$'s (for steps north) of length $(n+1) + n = 2n+1$. Each pair of lattice paths is a covering pair in exactly one of the two partial orders, the Lagrange order or the matching order.

Each line in a file is the concatenation of two 0-1 sequences (one for each path) for a length $4n+2$ row of $0$'s and $1$'s. The two lattice paths are separated by ``;``. For example, on a $3 \times 2$ grid, the sequence:
``1,1,1,0,0;1,1,0,1,0``
corresponds to the two lattice paths in the figure above. The first is in red and second is in blue, with segments traversed by both paths colored red. 

The file names are:

- ``lagrange_covers_train_10_9.txt``
- ``lagrange_covers_train_11_10.txt``
- ``lagrange_covers_train_12_11.txt``
- ``lagrange_covers_train_13_12.txt``
- ``lagrange_covers_test_10_9.txt``
- ``lagrange_covers_test_11_10.txt``
- ``lagrange_covers_test_12_11.txt``
- ``lagrange_covers_test_13_12.txt``

The datasets can be loaded by: (1) unzipping the file found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wm9mtZQjXXQ4rl0TU9KtJ1T4RQaGsJNz/view?usp=sharing) in your chosen `directory` and then running the following commands (here we choose $n = 10$)

```
import numpy as np
import load_datasets 

folder = # provide the file path to the directory you chose here
X = load_datasets.get_dataset('lattice_paths', n=10, folder = folder)
```

## Data Generation

Datasets were generated using SageMath. A SageMath notebook with the code to do this can be found in this repository \[3\].

## Task

**Math question:** As stated in [\[1\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02185), the problem is to "Study the posets $\mathcal{D}(a,b)$ â€¦ with respect to $\leq_L$ and $\leq_M$." Where $\mathcal{D}(a,b)$ is the set of all NE lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(a,b)$ that never pass above the diagonal and with $a,b$ relatively prime. 

**ML task:** Recall that $x$ covers $y$ in a partial order if $y < x$ and there is no $z$ such that $y < z < x$. Given a pair of lattice paths $(w,w')$, train a model that can predict whether $w'$ covers $w$ in either matching or Lagrange order (cases where $w'$ covers $w$ in both orders are few and have been excluded). 

Note that the ML task is far more specific than the math question. The idea is that a model that can effectively identify covers, has probably extracted useful features from lattice paths that carry interesting information about the partial orders $\leq_L$ and $\leq_M$.

## Small model performance

| Size | Logistic regression | MLP | Transformer | TODO | 
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| $n= 10$ | $66.2\\%$ | $90.6\\% \pm 0.8\\%$ | $65.3\\% \pm 0.0\\%$| $0.0\\%$ |
| $n= 11$ | $66.3\\%$ | $95.8\\% \pm 0.3\\%$ | $69.4\\% \pm 6.0\\%$| $0.0\\%$ |
| $n= 12$ | $66.5\\%$ | $98.6\\% \pm 0.1\\%$ | $86.2\\% \pm 14.2\\%$| $0.0\\%$ |

The $\pm$ signs indicate 95% confidence intervals from random weight initialization and training.
